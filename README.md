## Pitch
Play as an astronaut who ventures into an abandoned space station looking for parts to repair his damaged ship. As he ventures into the station a strange sense lurks into him. Almost like he is not alone... like there is somebody watching him in the darkness.

**Station Obscurum** is a 3D Dungeon Delving adventure game. Travel into the depths of the station, fight creepy monsters and station security to obtain the parts you need to repair your space ship.
